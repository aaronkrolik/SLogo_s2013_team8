Files Used:

the thing greatly.

None other than the .java files included


Using the program:
Contains all of the functionality noted in Part 2
and Part 3.
Note:  The Wallforce.java class in the simulation package is outdated!  
For the current wallforce code, look in the simulation package, go into the wallforce folder,
and find all of the current wallforces.

Bugs:
When dragging around the springs with the mouse, if you go off the canvas, the program will break.
No other bugs.

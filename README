JACK MATTEUCCI, AARON KROLIK, DAVID LIU, and BILL MUENSTERMAN's SPRINGIES README

Names of people who worked on project:  JACK MATTEUCCI, AARON KROLIK, DAVID LIU, and BILL MUENSTERMAN

Started February 22th, Finished March 8th 

Time spent: ~ 80 hours in total

Description of the program:
-GUI:
  Bill Muensterman and David Liu worked on the GUI part.
  The SlogoGUI class is the major element of the GUI. It is essentially a JFrame, with a MenuBar, a Canvas, a TextField, 
  a Button, and a List.
-Model/Parser
 Jack Matteucci and Aaron Krolik worked on the Model/turtle/parser.  
Resources used:
Regular Compsci Resources
http://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/cps108/current/assign/03_slogo/
https://piazza.com/class#spring2013/compsci308001sp13/104

Files Used:
We modified the Canvas class, Main Class from last code. We also reused the vector class,
PixMap class, Location class, and Text Class from last project.

Resources Need:  
None other than the .java files included and the images in the image file.


Using the program:
Contains all of the functionality noted in Part 2.  We were not able to implement some of the specs
noted in part 3, such as the commands askwith, define, for and the new version of repeat.  We also
were not able to implement recursion or scope.
Parser is in util.

Notes:  There are many interfaces in order to restrict access to certain methods.  We also have a
recursive desent parser that we were not able to finally implement, but would have contributed to
better design/extendability.

Bugs:
Everything should work except the functionality we were not able to implement.


Suggestions:  Hard but great project!

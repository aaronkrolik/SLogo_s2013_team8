Names of people who worked on project:  JACK MATTEUCCI, AARON KROLIK, DAVID LIU, and BILL MUENSTERMAN

Started February 22th, Finished March 8th 

Time spent: ~ 50 hours in total

Description of the program:
-GUI:
  Bill Muensterman and David Liu worked on the GUI part.
  The SlogoGUI class is the major element of the GUI. It is essentially a JFrame, with a MenuBar, a Canvas, a TextField, 
  a Button, and a List.

https://piazza.com/class#spring2013/compsci308001sp13/104

Files Used:
We modified the Canvas class, Main Class from last code. We also reused the vector class,
PixMap class, Location class, and Text Class from last project.

Resources Need:  
None other than the .java files included and the one turtle image


Using the program:
Contains all of the functionality noted in Part 2.

Notes:  There are many interfaces in order to restrict access to certain methods.  We also used
several rapper classes around lists, but we believe everything is fairly essential

Bugs:
Everything should work!


Suggestions:  Great project!
